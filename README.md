## History
* Created in 1995 by __Brendan Eich__, a Netscape engineer;
* First released with Netscape 2 early in 1996;
* Named as JavaScript instead of LiveScript for marketing reason, although it has very little in common with the popular Sun Microsystem's Java language;
* Later, Netscape submitted JavaScript to [Ecma International](http://www.ecma-international.org) and became the first edition of ECMAScript standard of that year. 
* Significant update in 1999, resulted in ECMAscript edition 3;
* JavaScript major updates: edition 5(2009), edition 6(2015).
